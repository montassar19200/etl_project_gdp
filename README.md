# etl_project_gdp
In this project, you'll create a Python ETL pipeline to extract GDP data by country from the IMF website, process it, and store it in both a JSON file and an SQLite database. You'll also log execution steps and display economies over 100 billion USD. The script must be reusable for biannual IMF updates.
